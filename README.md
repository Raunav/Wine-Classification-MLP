# Wine-Classification-MLP
Implementation of a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) model from scratch to classify wine data into three types using chemical analysis attributes.

### Key Outcomes
- Built and trained a custom MLP model using backpropagation.
- Evaluated performance using 5-fold cross-validation.
- Compared results against a baseline random model.

### Running the Notebook
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Raunav/Wine-Classification-MLP.git

2. Install dependencies:

3. Open the notebook:

4. Run the cells step by step.

### Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Wine Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine).

### Results
The custom-built MLP achieved X% accuracy, outperforming the baseline accuracy of Y%.
